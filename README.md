# Anual stock performance  
The Analysis is created for Steve so that he can perform Stock Peformance for the year of his choosing.   teh program has been modified to reduce run time. 

## Run time: original vs Refractored code
Analysis was done using the original code which seem to take longer to execute.  Changes were made to the code to reduce the execution time.  As you can see in below imaiges, for both years (2017, 2018) the execution time is much less in the refractored code.

## Changes to Code
in order to acheive above improved performance,  certain changes to code were made. Such as using variables to store data in temporary space rather than hard coding. 


## Summary
In summary,  while i was able to refactor the original code to get optimize the execution time, it imayt always the case.  a refactored code can be confusing to read so having explaination and commetns are very import part of coding.
